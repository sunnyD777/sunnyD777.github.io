<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p style = " margin:10px 400px 15px 0px; font-size: 125%;text-align : justify;">The planet Earth faces many major problems. In a micro perspective such problems include racism, 
inequality, and sexism, and while these problems are very troublesome for the inhabitants of Earth, they
do not affect the planet itself. Looking in a macro perspective, the greatest problem that both the Earth and 
Earthlings face is <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-k4.html" target = "_blank">
 Climate Change</a>, with the most major consquence of it being the <b>rise in sea levels</b>.</p>
<br>

<h2 style = "text-align:center"> Why Is It Happening? </h2>
<ul>
<li> Thermal Expansion </li>
<img src = "https://www.plumbingsupply.com/images/what-is-thermal-expansion.jpg" alt = "Thermal Expansion Diagram" style = "float:right;width:354px; height:170px; margin-right:225px;" </img> 
<p style = "margin:15px 725px 0px 0px;text-align:justify;font-size:115%;"> 
As ocean water heats up, its density decreases. 
Considering mass must remain constant and that Density = Mass/Volume, volume must 
increase as it is inversely proportional with density. This is what is known as <b>
thermal expansion</b>. Water expands proportional to a given heat input, 
so the global average expansion of ocean water depends on the ubiquitous distribution
of heat within the ocean("11.2 Factors"). Over the past century, the average global temperature within oceans has
risen 0.18°F ("Sea Temperature Rise.")</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li > Melting of Glaciers & Ice Caps </li>
<img src = "http://www.climate-change-guide.com/images/glacier.jpg" alt = "Polar Ice Cap Melting" style = "float:right;width:354px; height:202px; margin-right:225px;" </img> 
<p style = "margin:15px 725px 0px 0px;text-align:justify;font-size:115%;">
Another reason why the sea level is increasing is due to the increased melting 
of large ice formations such as glaciers and ice caps. Typically in the summer, 
these ice formations become partially melted due to the temperature of the season,
 which is then later balanced out in winter when it snows. Recently, however, 
due to the increasing rise in the global average temperature, there have been
 greater than average summer meltings coupled with less snowing due to 
later winters and earlier springs. Because of this imbalance, the ratio
 between runoff meltwater and ocean evaporation  has increased significantly thus 
causing the sea level to rise ("Sea Level Rise.").</p>
</ul>

<h2 style= "float:right; margin-right:150px"> What Are the Consequences?</h2>
<p style = "float:right; text-align:justify; font-size: 115%; margin-left: 750px;margin-right:50px;"> 
Increased sea level elevation can have catastrophic effects on coastal habitats. 
Rising sea levels can send salt water further inland where it can contaminate fresh 
groundwater and ruin peoples' fresh water supply. Additionally, higher sea levels 
give rise to higher and more destructive waves which can result in destructive coastal
 erosion. During storms, this erosion can become even more cataclysmic and ruin 
important things such soil, roads, and infrastructures. And most obviously, increased
 sea levels can lead to increased vulnerability to major flooding and could potentially 
force people to abandon their homes. The flooding may even completely submerge small island nations.
 Almost half of the world's population, 3 billion people, live within 200 km of a coastline, 
and are thus vulnerable to such effects ("Sea Levels Are"). </p>

<h2 style = "margin-top:300px"> How to Prevent It? </h2>
<p style = "margin:15px 725px 0px 0px;text-align:justify;font-size:120%;">
The root cause of sea level elevation is global warming. The atmospheric increase in 
gaseous compounds that trap heat, otherwise known as <b> greenhouse gases</b>, 
has caused the Earth's temperatures to rise, with oceans absorbing around 80% of
 this additional heat ("Sea Level Rise"). Many of these greenhouse emissions are caused by human activity, 
and to counter future sea level rise, we must implement the following. </p>
<ul>
<li> Renewable Energy Source </li>
<img src = "http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/renewables1.jpg" alt = "Non-renewable vs Renewable energy" style = "float:right;width:375px; height:200px; margin-right:225px;margin-top:35px" </img> 
<p style = "margin:15px 725px 0px 0px;text-align:justify;font-size:115%;">
The burning of fossil fuels has become an integral and essential part of our society.
One key example of how we use it is for the fuel for our cars. Unfortunately
when fossil fuels are burnt, the carbon inside of them is released and combines
 with oxygen in the air to yield carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>), one of the most major greenhouse gases. 
Additionally as the name suggests, fossil fuels are formed from prehistoric fossils and are
 considered a non-renewable source of energy because they take millions of years to form. 
A better and more efficient form of energy would be renewable energy, energy formed from natural 
resources that are continuously replenished (i.e. sunlight, wind, rain, etc.). Use of renewable
 energy sources would alleviate carbon emission into the atmosphere, and effectively thus help 
reduce the rate of global warming and seal level rise ("Causes of the").</p>

<li> Less Deforestation </li>

<p style = "margin:15px 725px 0px 0px;text-align:justify;font-size:115%;">
Another contributor to the global warming is deforestation, the cutting down
 of trees and forests for industrial use. Trees' importance lies in their
 ability to perform the process known as photosynthesis, where plants use 
energy from sunlight to synthesize food. In this process, trees intake carbon
 dioxide and release oxygen, so increased deforestation not only leads to 
increased concentration  CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere,  it also gives us less 
oxygen to breathe. Additionally the burning of tree bark releases the stored 
carbon back into the air where it once again turns into carbon dioxide. Instead of
 destroying trees for large scale developments, we should rather start planting them 
to improve the livelihood of our planet ("Causes of the").
